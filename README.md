Documentation for Photonbot  

Photonbot is responsible for running voting and role selection for the Jouers Sans Fronti√®res server.  

The vote command can be used to begin a proceeding. Use it only in the #suggestions channel.  
Vote Operations:  
    -Ban  
    -Unban  
    -Mute  
    -Unmute  
    -Deafen  
    -Undeafen  
    -Kick  
    -Optin (vote user into cadidate pool for community manager)  
    -Optout  
    -Miscellaneous  
Serious votes (bans, unbans, and kicks) will last for three days, while others will last for two and a half minutes, excepting only misc votes, which will have varied running times.  
If you are beginning a miscellaneous vote, you must still specify a user, but this user will not be involved in the vote menu.
Optin votes will last for one day.  
Reasons (or descriptions, in the case of misc votes,) must be written in double quotes.

Examples:  
~vote ban @Minky "Violation of rule #3"  
~vote misc @Photon "Invite David?" 60

After being opted into the candidate pool, you will be considered every two days for community manager. Community manager can create and delete roles and channels, and can add and remove roles from people, but cannot perform any actual administrative functions.
